Before I became deeply involved in design and product, my foundation was in **Industrial and Operations Engineering**. That background fundamentally shaped how I think — not just about interfaces, but about systems, people, workflows, and outcomes.

I don't look at products in isolation. I look at the entire system: how work flows through people, tools, decisions, and constraints — and how to make that system more efficient, effective, and sustainable. Today, AI amplifies that mindset.

## Thinking in Systems, Not Screens

As an operations and industrial engineer, my responsibility was never limited to "doing my part." It was about understanding the end-to-end process: identifying where work slows down, where effort is wasted, and where quality drops under pressure.

That same thinking carries directly into my design work. When I design a feature or a dashboard, I'm not only asking if it's usable. I'm asking:

- Does this reduce cognitive load?
- Does this shorten decision time?
- Does this eliminate unnecessary steps?
- Does this help teams move faster without burning out?

AI helps me model and validate these questions faster than ever before.

## The Phoenix Project & Workflow Analysis

My process is deeply influenced by **"The Phoenix Project"**. In several companies, I worked as an operations engineer alongside design and product teams. I also acted as a **Scrum Master**, where my focus was improving how the entire team worked — not just what they delivered.

Using AI, I now replicate that process by analyzing workflow patterns, identifying bottlenecks in task handoffs, and stress-testing delivery timelines before they break. Instead of relying purely on intuition, AI allows me to quantify friction.

## Balancing Utilization Without Burning People Out

One of the most valuable lessons from industrial engineering is this: **Maximum utilization does not equal maximum productivity.**

With AI, I can model scenarios to ensure that no single team member becomes a "Brent" (the single point of failure). I look at:

- What happens if one designer or engineer is overloaded?
- How work quality degrades when utilization exceeds sustainable limits.
- Where redistributing tasks improves output without increasing hours.

## Metrics I Care About (and Design For)

Because of my background, I naturally think in metrics. AI helps me surface and interpret them:

- **Cycle Time:** How long it takes to move from idea to delivery.
- **Throughput:** How much value a system produces over time.
- **Work-in-Progress (WIP):** How much unfinished work creates hidden delays.
- **Utilization Rate:** Identifying overworked vs underutilized team members.
- **Rework Rate:** How often unclear design causes wasted effort.

## AI as a Decision-Support Tool

AI doesn't make decisions for me — it helps me see the system more clearly. I use it to simulate operational outcomes and compare trade-offs between speed, quality, and cost. This is where my roles intersect:

**Industrial Engineer** → understands systems | **Operations Engineer** → optimizes workflows | **Design Engineer** → translates complexity into clarity.

## Conclusion: Aesthetics Meet Efficiency

I don't design for aesthetics alone. I design for **flow, efficiency, resilience, and people**. Aligning user experience with business reality is my core strength. AI simply allows me to do that work faster, deeper, and with fewer blind spots.
